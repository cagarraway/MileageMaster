# MileageMaster
This simple project, functionally, is about simply recording the mileage of my family's vehicles, and viewing their significant statistics.

Objectively, the project has several goals:
1. I actually want such an application. I've been recording the mileages in an Excel file, but navigating that on a phone is inconvenient, so I thought I'd build an app.
2. It would be my first foray into the world of open source, in case anyone's interested in such a simple and overdone project. I see lots of similar (and more functional) apps on Google Play, but I'm not doing this for publicity; I just want to begin doing more open source projects. As such, I'm sure a lot of what I do in terms of documentation and issue organisation may be... unusual, but it will be part of the learning process.
3. I want to use this to learn how to implement Clean Architecture (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
4. I continue to learn Git as I do more projects on Github
